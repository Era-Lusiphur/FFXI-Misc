## FFXI-UpdatePatch
This is the update patch FFXI private server players can use to force File Check allow you to select Final Fantasy XI and update it. This is the exact file offered by DSP, which is deprecated as of the time of this upload.

Just overwrite this into your “C:\Program Files (x86)\PlayOnline\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XI” (default location) prior to running File Check. It will allow you to select FINAL FANTASY XI in the drop-down menu there.
